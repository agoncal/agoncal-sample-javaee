New Java 7 language features that are discussed include switch-on-string and try-with-resources. APIs that are discussed include Threading, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Swing, Java 2D, networking, JDBC, SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, JAX-WS, and SAAJ. This book also presents an introduction to Android app development so that you can apply some of its knowledge to the exciting world of Android app development. This book presents the following table of contents:Chapter 1 introduces you to Java and begins to cover the Java language by focusing on fundamental concepts such as comments, identifiers, variables, expressions, and statements. Chapter 2 continues to explore this language by presenting all of its features for working with classes and objects. You learn about features related to class declaration and object creation, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and garbage collection. Chapter 3 focuses on the more advanced language features related to nested classes, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Additional chapters introduce you to the few features not covered in Chapters 1 through 3.Chapter 4 largely moves away from covering language features (although it does introduce class literals and strictfp) while focusing on language-oriented APIs. You learn about Math, StrictMath, Package, Primitive Type Wrapper Classes, Reference, Reflection, String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder, Threading, BigDecimal, and BigInteger in this chapter. Chapter 5 begins to explore Java''s utility APIs by focusing largely on the Collections Framework. However, it also discusses legacy collection-oriented APIs and how to create your own collections. Chapter 6 continues to focus on utility APIs by presenting the concurrency utilities along with the Objects and Random classes. Chapter 7 moves you away from the command-line user interfaces that appear in previous chapters and toward graphical user interfaces. You first learn about the Abstract Window Toolkit foundation, and then explore the Java Foundation Classes in terms of Swing and Java 2D. Appendix C explores Accessibility and Drag and Drop.Chapter 8 explores filesystem-oriented I/O in terms of the File, RandomAccessFile, stream, and writer/reader classes. Chapter 9 introduces you to Java''s network APIs (e.g., sockets). It also introduces you to the JDBC API for interacting with databases along with the Java DB database product. Chapter 10 dives into Java''s XML support by first presenting an introduction to XML (including DTDs and schemas). It next explores the SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, and XSLT APIs. It even briefly touches on the Validation API. While exploring XPath, you encounter namespace contexts, extension functions and function resolvers, and variables and variable resolvers. Chapter 11 introduces you to Java''s support for SOAP-based and RESTful web services. As well as providing you with the basics of these web service categories, Chapter 11 presents some advanced topics, such as working with the SAAJ API to communicate with a SOAP-based web service without having to rely on JAX-WS. You will appreciate having learned about XML in Chapter 10 before diving into this chapter. Chapter 12 helps you put to use some of the knowledge you''ve gathered in previous chapters by showing you how to use Java to write an Android app''s source code. This chapter introduces you to Android, discusses its architecture, shows you how to install necessary tools, and develops a simple app. Appendix A presents the solutions to the programming exercises that appear near the end of Chapters 1 through 12. Appendix B introduces you to Java''s Scripting API along with Java 7''s support for dynamically typed languages. Appendix C introduces you to additional APIs and architecture topics. Examples include Accessibility, classloaders, Console, Drag and Drop, Java Native Interface, and System Tray. Appendix D presents a gallery of significant applications that demonstrate various aspects of Java. Unfortunately, there are limits to how much knowledge can be crammed into a print book. For this reason, Appendixes A, B, C, and D are not included in this book''s pages. Instead, these appendixes are freely distributed as PDF files. Appendixes A and B are bundled with the book''s associated code file at the Apress website (http://www.apress.com/9781430239093). Appendixes C and D are bundled with their respective code files at my TutorTutor.ca website (http://tutortutor.ca/cgi-bin/makepage.cgi?/books/bj7).What you’ll learnThe entire Java language, including Java 7-specific features such as switch on string, try-with-resources, final rethrow, multicatch, and SafeVarargs A huge assortment of Java 7 APIs, beginning with those APIs oriented toward the language itself, and including Java 7-specific APIs such as the Fork/Join Framework, Objects, and JLayer Various Java 7 tools, starting with the javac compiler and java application launcherHow to create user interfaces, working with web services, and a whole lot moreThe basics of getting started with Android app developmentWho this book is forThis book targets the following groups of developers:Newcomers, skilled (to some degree) in other programming languages but with no previous exposure to Java Intermediate Java developers, skilled in the fundamentals of Java prior to Java 7 and looking to increase their understanding of Java 7 language/API changes All developers looking beyond standard Java, who want to leverage Java 7 to create mobile apps via Android Even advanced Java developers may find a few items of interest.Table of ContentsGetting Started with JavaDiscovering Classes and ObjectsExploring Advanced Language FeaturesTouring Language and Utility APIsCollecting ObjectsTouring Additional Utility APIsCreating and Enriching Graphical User InterfacesInteracting with FilesystemsInteracting with Networks and DatabasesParsing, Creating, and Transforming XML DocumentsWorking with Web ServicesJava 7 Meets Android')

OverviewSee how the hardware and the JVM impact performanceLearn which Java features to use with Clojure, and howDeep dive into Clojure''s concurrency and state primitivesDiscover how to design Clojure programs for performanceIn DetailClojure is a young, dynamic, functional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It is built with performance, pragmatism, and simplicity in mind. Like most general purpose languages, Clojure’s features have different performance characteristics that one should know in order to write high performance code. Clojure High Performance Programming is a practical, to-the-point guide that shows you how to evaluate the performance implications of different Clojure abstractions, learn about their underpinnings, and apply the right approach for optimum performance in real-world programs. This book discusses the Clojure language in the light of performance factors that you can exploit in your own code. You will also learn about hardware and JVM internals that also impact Clojure’s performance. Key features include performance vocabulary, performance analysis, optimization techniques, and how to apply these to your programs. You will also find detailed information on Clojure''s concurrency, state-management, and parallelization primitives. This book is your key to writing high performance Clojure code using the right abstraction, in the right place, using the right technique. What you will learn from this bookLearn techniques for achieving numerical performance in ClojureUse Java features in Clojure code for performanceAvoid reflection and boxing with type hintsAnalyze latency using the Criterium libraryUnderstand Clojure''s concurrency and state-management primitives in depthExplore how to design Clojure applications for better performanceApproachThis is a short, practical guide that will teach you everything you need to know to start writing high performance Clojure code. Who this book is written forThis book is ideal for intermediate Clojure developers who are looking to get a good grip on how to achieve optimum performance. You should already have some experience with Clojure and it would help if you already know a little bit of Java. Knowledge of performance analysis and engineering is not required. For hands-on practice, you should have access to Clojure REPL with Leiningen.')

It is simply a snapshot of a constantly developing sound. Virtuoso Jazz tones merge with electro-beat samples and TripHop elements; they change colour without completely losing their form and come together in melodic song-structures. The 10 new member states of the EU provide the basic concept and the inspirational source of this album. Each track is devoted to a country and holds a musical journey whose stages are made more fascinating by their wealth of colour and the virtuoso interaction of the musicians.
